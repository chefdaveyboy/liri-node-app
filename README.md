LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.  Using Node.js LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

Using specific commands, you'll be able to search for upcoming concerts, song information, and movie information.

Using the concert-this command followed by an artist, you'll be able to see the top 3 upcoming concert from a specific artist or band.

Using the spotify-this-song command followed by the name of a song, you'll be able to see song information including a link to the song via spotify.

Using the movie-this command followed by a movie name, you'll be able to see relevant information about the movie you entered.

Using the do-what-it-says command, you'll be able to run a pre-built command in the random.txt file.
